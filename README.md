# WebRTC PeerConnection Build Script

This is a Dockerfile to build the WebRTC PeerConnection for Android
using the new GN based build system.

**NOTE: We do not provide any support related to building special versions, or
related to issues with your Docker installation, or with regard to bugs in the
WebRTC codebase itself. We also do not provide any support on how to integrate
the resulting build into your application.**

## Usage

First, build the base image:

    ./build-base.sh

This will download lots and lots of data from the Chromium project. On our test
system, it took about 1-1.5 hours with a resulting image being 47 GiB.

Then, start the actual build process based on the previously downloaded data:

    ./build.sh

This will take probably around 0.5-1 hour. Once the script finished, you'll get
the following output in the `out/` directory:

 - `libwebrtc.jar`
 - `arm/libjingle_peerconnection_so.so`
 - `x86/libjingle_peerconnection_so.so`
 - `arm64/libjingle_peerconnection_so.so`
 - `x64/libjingle_peerconnection_so.so`
 - `revision.txt`
 - `patches.txt`
 - `build_args.txt`

If you want a non-release build, or if you want to build for other platforms,
feel free to adjust the Dockerfiles.

To build a certain commit version, adjust the `build/Dockerfile` like this:

```diff
diff --git a/build/Dockerfile b/build/Dockerfile
index ed471e9..9198581 100644
--- a/build/Dockerfile
+++ b/build/Dockerfile
@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@ RUN cd /webrtc/src/third_party \

-RUN git checkout master && git pull && gclient sync
+RUN git checkout master && git pull && git checkout branch-heads/3987 && gclient sync
 
 # Apply patches
 RUN mkdir /webrtc/src/patches
```

You'll only have to update the base image from time to time, maybe every few
weeks to months. It's a big "upfront cost" but it will reduce the duration of
the actual build.

## Custom patches

You can also apply custom patches during the build process. Put a `.patch` file
inside the `build/patches/` directory, then it should be applied automatically.

The patch should be created using `git diff` inside the /webrtc/src directory
(checkout of the https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc.git repo):

    $ git diff > my-changes.patch

## Troubleshooting

### Docker: «No space left on device»

If you use Docker with the `devicemapper` storage driver, it's possible that
you get "no space left on device" errors even though there's still disk space
left. This has to do with the way the storage is managed by Docker.

To check the used storage driver, use the `docker info` command.

To solve this issue, either [increase the devicemapper pool
size](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/01/29/docker-device-mapper-resize/) or
switch to a file system based storage driver like `overlay2`.
